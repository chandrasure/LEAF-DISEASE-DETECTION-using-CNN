# LEAF-DISEASE-DETECTION-using-CNN
Involves leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify and classify diseases in plant leaves from images. The model processes leaf images, extracts features like texture and color patterns, and predicts the presence of specific diseases to aid in early diagnosis and effective crop management.
